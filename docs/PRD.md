# Product Requirements Document - ElevenLabs Text-to-Speech for VSCode

## Executive summary

This guide provides a complete framework for writing a Product Requirements Document (PRD) for a VSCode extension that integrates ElevenLabs text-to-speech functionality. Based on industry best practices and technical research, this PRD structure addresses the unique requirements of developer tools while considering VSCode's API capabilities, audio processing constraints, and user experience needs. The extension will enable developers to listen to markdown and text files with advanced playback controls, visual highlighting, and audio export capabilities.

## Core PRD structure and sections

### 1. Product overview and purpose

**Essential Components:**

- **Extension Name**: ElevenLabs Text-to-Speech for VSCode
- **Value Proposition**: Enable developers to consume written content through high-quality voice synthesis while coding
- **Problem Statement**: Reading long documentation or markdown files causes eye strain and interrupts coding flow
- **Target Users**: Developers who work with extensive documentation, technical writers, accessibility-focused users
- **Success Metrics**: Daily active users, average session duration, audio generation volume, user retention rate

### 2. Technical requirements and specifications

**VSCode Extension Manifest Requirements:**

```json
{
  "engines": { "vscode": "^1.74.0" },
  "activationEvents": ["onLanguage:markdown", "onLanguage:plaintext"],
  "categories": ["Accessibility", "Other"],
  "main": "./out/extension.js"
}
```

**Core Technical Specifications:**

- **Node.js Version**: 16.x or higher
- **TypeScript**: Required for development
- **Bundle Size**: Target <5MB excluding dependencies
- **Performance Benchmarks**:
  - Extension activation: <100ms
  - Audio generation start: <2s
  - Memory usage: <100MB baseline

### 3. Feature requirements and user stories

**Must-Have Features (MVP):**

1. **File Support and Editor Integration**

   - User Story: "As a developer, I want to listen to my markdown documentation so I can review content while coding"
   - Acceptance Criteria:
     - Support .md and .txt file types
     - Detect active file language automatically
     - Handle files up to 50MB

2. **Editor Title Bar Icon**

   - User Story: "As a user, I want quick access to TTS from the editor so I don't need to use commands"
   - Implementation: Use `contributes.menus` with `editor/title` location
   - Icon placement: Next to preview button for markdown files

3. **Context Menu Integration**

   - User Story: "As a user, I want to speak selected text so I can listen to specific portions"
   - Implementation: Add to `editor/context` menu with `editorHasSelection` condition

4. **Playback Controls**

   - User Story: "As a user, I want audio control so I can manage playback"
   - Required Controls: Play, Pause, Stop
   - UI Location: Sidebar webview (using WebviewViewProvider)

5. **Visual Text Highlighting**

   - User Story: "As a user, I want to see what's being read so I can follow along"
   - Implementation: VSCode Decoration API with synchronized highlighting
   - Display: Highlights directly in the editor window

6. **Audio Export**

   - User Story: "As a user, I want to save audio files so I can listen offline"
   - Formats: MP3 (primary), WAV (optional)
   - Storage: User-configurable location

7. **API Key Management**
   - User Story: "As a developer, I want secure API key storage so my credentials are protected"
   - Implementation: VSCode SecretStorage API
   - Configuration: Extension settings for non-sensitive preferences

**Nice-to-Have Features (Future):**

- Multiple voice selection
- Speed and pitch controls
- Batch file processing
- Bookmarking system
- Language auto-detection

### 4. API integration requirements

**ElevenLabs API Specifications:**

- **Endpoint**: `POST https://api.elevenlabs.io/v1/text-to-speech/{voice_id}`
- **Authentication**: Header-based API key (`xi-api-key`)
- **Rate Limits**: Plan-dependent (2-15 concurrent requests)
- **Character Limits**: 2,500 (free) to 5,000 (paid) per request
- **Audio Formats**: MP3 (default), PCM, Î¼-law
- **Error Handling**: Exponential backoff for rate limits

**Security Requirements:**

- API keys stored in VSCode SecretStorage
- No client-side key exposure
- HTTPS-only communication
- Input sanitization for user text

### 5. User interface and experience flows

**Installation and Setup Flow:**

1. Install extension from VSCode Marketplace
2. Prompt for ElevenLabs API key on first use
3. Validate API key and store securely
4. Display success notification

**Primary Use Case Flow:**

1. User opens markdown/text file
2. Clicks speaker icon in editor title bar
3. Extension opens playback controls in sidebar
4. Audio generation begins, text highlights in sync in the editor
5. User controls playback as needed
6. Optional: Save audio file

**Error States:**

- Invalid API key: Clear error message with setup link
- Rate limit exceeded: Queue request with user notification
- Network failure: Offline mode with retry option
- Unsupported file: Graceful degradation message

### 6. Technical architecture and constraints

**Architecture Components:**

1. **Extension Core** (`extension.ts`): Command registration, activation logic
2. **Audio Manager** (`audioManager.ts`): ElevenLabs API client, audio processing
3. **Highlight Manager** (`highlightManager.ts`): Text decoration, position tracking
4. **Webview Provider** (`webviewProvider.ts`): Sidebar UI, playback controls
5. **Storage Manager** (`storageManager.ts`): Cache, file operations

**VSCode-Specific Constraints:**

- **Audio Playback**: Limited codec support requires Web Audio API
- **File Access**: Restricted to workspace and extension storage
- **UI Limitations**: No direct DOM access, webview-only custom UI
- **Performance**: Large file handling requires chunking strategy

**Implementation Patterns:**

```typescript
// Text highlighting example
const decorationType = vscode.window.createTextEditorDecorationType({
  backgroundColor: "rgba(255, 255, 0, 0.3)",
});

// Audio storage pattern
const audioUri = vscode.Uri.joinPath(
  context.globalStorageUri,
  `audio_${timestamp}.mp3`
);
```

### 7. Non-functional requirements

**Performance Requirements:**

- Response time: <2s for audio generation start
- Concurrent operations: Support 3+ file processing
- Memory efficiency: Stream large files vs. full loading
- Cache strategy: LRU with 100MB limit

**Accessibility Requirements:**

- Keyboard navigation for all controls
- Screen reader compatibility
- High contrast theme support
- Configurable playback speeds

**Compatibility Requirements:**

- VSCode versions: 1.74.0+
- Operating Systems: Windows 10+, macOS 10.15+, Linux (Ubuntu 18.04+)
- Node.js runtime: Built-in VSCode Node.js

### 8. Development and testing requirements

**Development Setup:**

- TypeScript configuration with strict mode
- ESLint + Prettier for code quality
- Webpack for bundling
- GitHub Actions for CI/CD

**Testing Strategy:**

- Unit tests: Core business logic (80% coverage target)
- Integration tests: VSCode API interactions
- Manual testing: Audio playback across platforms
- User acceptance: Beta testing program

**Publishing Requirements:**

- VSCode Marketplace compliance
- Extension size optimization
- README with clear documentation
- CHANGELOG maintenance
